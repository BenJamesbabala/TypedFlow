# TypedFlow

TypedFlow is a typed, higher-order frontend to
[TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org) and a high-level library for
deep-learning.

In this version, the interface to TensorFlow is done via python-code
generation and a suitable runtime system.

Documentation: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/TypedFlow

Examples:
 - adaptation of the [MNIST tensorflow tutorial](examples/MNIST)
 - [simple sequence to sequence model](examples/seq2seq)
