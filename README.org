#+TITLE: TypedFlow

TypedFlow is a typed, higher-order frontend to [[http://www.tensorflow.org][TensorFlow]] and a
high-level library for deep-learning.

In this version, the interface to TensorFlow is done via python-code
generation and a suitable runtime system.

Documentation: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/TypedFlow

Examples:
 - adaptation of the [[examples/MNIST][MNIST tensorflow tutorial]]
 - A simple [[examples/seq2seq][sequence to sequence model]] which
   attempts to learn to translate pre-order into post-order.

To running the examples can be done like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.haskellPackages.styx
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.cabal2nix
styx configure
cd examples/seq2seq
make
#+END_SRC
